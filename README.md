# PWA(Progressive Web App) Calendar

The core functionalities of a calendar into a PWA(Progressive Web App) - an app created with web
tehnologies(in this case React), that can be run on every device as a 'native' one. You will not
need to open the browser and search for it, there will be a homescreen icon from where you can
access it, like any other native app. <br /> <br /> You can find the app here:

## Structure

The app is structured in 3 tabs, appointments, statistics and settings.

### Appointments

This is the most important tab, from here you can create/read/update/delete(CRUD) appointments. You
can organize them by date, hour or group.

<div style="display: flex;">
<img alt="Appointments" title="Appointments" src="./readme-images/appointments/index.png" style="width: 33%; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;" />
<img alt="Add appointment" title="Add appointment" src="./readme-images/appointments/add.png" style="width: 33%; height: auto; margin-right: 10px;" />
<img alt="Edit appointment" title="Edit appointment" src="./readme-images/appointments/edit.png" style="width: 33%; height: auto;" />
</div>

### Statistics

Here you can view statistics about all your appointments.(At this moment there is just the 'group
completion' card) <br />
<img alt="Statistics" title="Statistics" src="./readme-images/statistics.png" style="width: 33%;" />

### Settings

This tab contains settings that can be tweaked by the user.(At this moment there is just the theme
button) <br />
<img alt="Settings" title="Settings" src="./readme-images/settings.png" style="width: 33%;" />
